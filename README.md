### Optimize-Gradient-Descent-Learning-Rate
Optimize Gradient Descent Learning Rate:
* Using descent algorithm for $f(x,y)$ with Itertative Gradient Descent Algoritem:
 $Z_0$ = Initial guess
 $$Z_{n+1}=Z_{n}-\alpha\cdot\nabla f(Z_{n})$$ 
To find the optimal α of the function with Golden Section Search Algorithm on the interval $[0,1]$
